                        <p>Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping the way we communicate,
                            work, and live. From the earliest tools created by humans to the sophisticated digital
                            systems of today, technology has continually evolved, driving societal progress and
                            transformation. This article explores the history, advancements, and impact of technology,
                            highlighting its role in shaping the future.

                        <h3>Manuel Testing</h3>
                        <p>Manual testing is a fundamental aspect of software quality assurance. Despite the rise of
                            automation, manual testing remains crucial for scenarios where human intuition, creativity,
                            and exploratory skills are required. This guide explores the principles, techniques, and
                            best practices of manual testing, equipping you with the knowledge to ensure that your
                            software meets the highest standards of quality.

                        <p>
                            Automation testing is the process of using specialized software tools to execute tests on a
                            software application automatically, comparing the actual outcomes with the expected results.
                            This is in contrast to manual testing, where a human tester manually executes test cases.
                            Automation testing is especially useful for repetitive tasks, regression testing, and
                            scenarios that require multiple data sets or extensive user interactions.

                        <p>
                            This is a simple web-based game where the computer selects a random number
                            between 1 and 100, and the player's task is to guess the number. After each guess, the game
                            provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low, helping the player
                            narrow down the correct number. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the
                            number, with the total number of attempts displayed at the end.
